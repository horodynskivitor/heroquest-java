# heroquest-java

This project aims to emulate the adventure/RPG board game HeroQuest written by the principles of Object Oriented Programming using the Java Programming Language.
It was developed from March 2020 to July 2020 as an assignment of an OOP class of the Computing Institute in the University of Campinas (Unicamp). Because of this, the menus and messages showed to the player are written in Brazilian Portuguese.

The main objective of this game is to slay all monsters within the map, which can be achieved by attack hostile creatures called monsters using one of the heroes selected by the player.
There are four types of Heroes which the player can choose to play as: Barbarian, Dwarf, Elf and Wizard. These four types differ by their attributes such as attack/defense points and the ability to throw spells at enemies.
Monsters can be either Goblins - which can follow the player, Skeletons and Wizard Skeletons. They always attack the player when the player attacks them.
There are hidden traps and treasures in the game. Traps can damage the player's health and treasures give items such as armor, weapons and throwable spells to the player.

I do not hold any copyright related to HeroQuest. This project has educational purposes only and will never be sold by me, anyone is welcome to do with it as they please.
